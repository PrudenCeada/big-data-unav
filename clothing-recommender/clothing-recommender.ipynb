    "Extracting a DataFrame - Weather-Based Clothing Recommender\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This deliverable aims to create a **DataFrame** for a system that provides **clothing recommendations based on weather data**. The system utilizes the **OpenWeatherMap API** to retrieve weather information for specific cities and generates personalized clothing suggestions based on factors such as **temperature, perceived temperature, rainfall, wind speed, and cloud coverage**. Additionally, the functionality is extended to include **hourly recommendations for today and the next 5 days**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project has practical applications in industries such as **tourism, fashion, and daily planning services**, providing a smart approach to daily preparation and personal logistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integration with OpenWeatherMap**:\n",
    "   - Retrieve weather data for a list of cities, including temperature, perceived temperature, rainfall, wind, and cloudiness.\n",
    "   - Obtain forecasts for today and the next 5 days, broken down into hourly segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generate clothing recommendations**:\n",
    "   - Provide clothing suggestions based on perceived temperature and rainfall probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data storage and export**:\n",
    "   - Create a **DataFrame** with the collected data and export it in **CSV** and **Excel** formats, including timestamps for easier analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## System Development\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Libraries**: `requests`, `pandas`, `datetime`\n",
    "- **Preliminary Setup**:\n",
    "  - Register an account on OpenWeatherMap and obtain an API key.\n",
    "  - Store the API key as an environment variable for security.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Development Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Defining the Recommendation Function**\n",
    "The `get_clothing_recommendation` function evaluates two main factors:\n",
    "- **Perceived temperature (`feels_like`)**: Adjusts the recommendation based on how cold or warm it feels.\n",
    "- **Rain (`rain`)**: Includes waterproof clothing in case of precipitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Retrieving Hourly Forecast**\n",
    "The `get_weather_data_next_days` function was designed to interact with the OpenWeatherMap API and obtain:\n",
    "- Weather data for today and the next 5 days.\n",
    "- Specific hourly segments (morning, afternoon, evening, night).\n",
    "- Additional variables such as temperature, wind, cloudiness, and rainfall.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each time segment, specific recommendations are assigned using the recommendation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Handling Time Zones**\n",
    "Deprecated methods (`utcfromtimestamp` and `utcnow`) were replaced with **timezone-aware objects** to ensure compatibility with future Python versions and correctly handle time zone differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Data Export**\n",
    "The collected and processed data is stored in a **Pandas DataFrame**, which is then exported in **CSV** and **Excel** formats, with filenames including the current date and time for easy identification.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generated Data**:\n",
    "   - Clothing recommendations based on hourly segments for over **200 cities** (main cities in Spain, Europe, and other major tourist regions).\n",
    "   - Consideration of multiple weather variables: temperature, perceived temperature, rainfall, wind speed, and cloud coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exported Files**:\n",
    "   - `weather_clothing_recommendations_<date>_<time>.csv`\n",
    "   - `weather_clothing_recommendations_<date>_<time>.xlsx`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example Output**:\n",
    "   A fragment of the DataFrame includes columns such as:\n",
    "   - City\n",
    "   - Hourly segment\n",
    "   - Temperature\n",
    "   - Perceived temperature\n",
    "   - Wind speed\n",
    "   - Cloud coverage\n",
    "   - Clothing recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Business Application of the Project**\n",
    "This project provides a solid foundation for developing a **personalized weather-based service**, with various commercial applications, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Personalized Clothing Recommender**:\n",
    "   - Provide specific clothing suggestions based on local weather conditions and hourly forecasts.\n",
    "   - Potential integration with marketplaces like **Amazon or Zalando** to directly recommend products.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Service for the Tourism Sector**:\n",
    "   - Generate **customized clothing and activity recommendations** for tourists based on weather conditions at their destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Integrated E-Commerce Platform**:\n",
    "   - Enhance customer experience by suggesting weather-related products **directly in an online store**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Weather Assistant for Professionals & Events**:\n",
    "   - Provide **detailed forecasts and clothing recommendations** for event organizers or outdoor workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "The developed system offers a comprehensive approach to **daily outfit planning**, considering detailed weather variables. This not only simplifies users' daily lives but also has the potential for integration into commercial applications in **tourism, retail fashion, and smart planning services**.\n"
